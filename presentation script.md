Hello, my name's Kyle.

Alex asked if I would like to come and share my experiences on our group module, to which it's apparent by me being here that I said yes!

I'm going to be real quick with running through my experience, I've only got 12 mins. If there's anything extra you'd like to know, please grab me at the end.


# Format

I'm going to cover 4 main, simple areas.

I'll tell you a bit about me to give you an understanding of the context in which I took this module

The things I loved about the module and what I think it does for you and your career

The bad things that I would like to improve

And a summary of things I would do a little differently next time

# About me


# The good

I think a module like this is massively important, especially to FST modules. It's the first, and only, insight into what a day in the life of our future careers is like, unless you're lucky enough to work in industry while studying.

Another reason that this module carries such significant value is because of the real life communication skills it teaches. Tech students stereotypically don't have very good communication skills, and also may lack confidence when working with other people. This is of course a large generalisation, but I feel that a lot of new comers to the tech industry have this feeling. I'm certainly one of them.

# Prepping for the real world

As most are aware, academia does not, in most cases, accurately represent the real world of it's teachings. While I was taking my group module, I was luck enough to be also working for a company, part time, mainly writing iOS software. So I was in a good position to be able to compare other modules, the group module, and real life, at the same time.

The communication required of the teams and the responsibilities given are very close to real life. I took several of the lessons that I learnt from my group project to where I'm working now. Those particularly being communication and people skills, of which there are not modules for.

Things like, conflict resolution, task and project management, 

# Culture experimentation

This one is particularly important to me. I've now worked in two startups. One quite mature and lead by an experienced team that's worked in industry for years. My current company having 3 out of 5 employees under the age of 23, with the CEO being one of them.

The thing that's made these companies great places to work and produce amazing results and rapid pace are they're culture. The products are so good because they *are* the culture and people who work there.

The trouble is that changing or experimenting with the culture of a startup is dangerous and quite hard to do in the real world. But with the simulation of this module, it allows the team to find which dynamics work, and which ones they like. It will help them discover what kinds of teams they want to work in.

They'll culture around things like discipline, habits, hierarchy or lack of, reward and celebration surrounding achievements, social dynamic and more.

# Practicing conflict resolution

Another important communication skill to learn for the real world is the ability to deal with both internal and external conflicts. 

Internal conflicts between members of the team/company are slightly more personal, and it's something that you get to practice in the group work. Running into differences in opinion on how a given task should be carried out or which design should be chosen provide the team with great experience to take to the workplace. Having these skills gives them an edge on other members of their team and a professional polish. 

# Practicing team workflows

This is an area that will be quite specific to your subject. For myself and other students doing FST modules, we're taught about methods on managing projects, of managing collaboration and product delivery, but practicing them again builds confidence for the real world and provides a clearer understanding to the students.


# The bad

The bad points that I have about the module are more aimed at it's spec and the way in which it's set up, not the idea of it. The idea of it and what it teaches you is fantastic, but there are a few specific properties that I would have changed about my particular module.

# Picking teams

In our module, we weren't allowed to pick our own teams, they were picked for us. The reason that this is bad, is that some high aspiring and driven students get paired with some students that aren't. This wastes their opportunity to learn all the good things that I have just described. They spend most of their time encouraging members of their team to work, which of course wouldn't happen in the real world since those people would likely get sacked after a few warnings of their lack of contribution.

You could say that it gives them a chance to practice managing motivation of their team, and I think you'd be right. But there's a balance. If the student is unable to inject motivation into their low aspiring team members for the duration of the module, then there's not much more that they'll take from it other than feeling like they've moaned at people and done all the work for a whole semester.

The only way to deal with this is to allow students to pick their teams, or at group together the groups with people matching their ability and motivation. That's half hard to gauge because universities to have a scale or grade for motivation.

If students are paired with other students that are motivated, for the most part it won't matter about either students ability. But when a high aspiring student is put with people that don't care, it wastes their prospects.

# If your team fails, you fail

In my marking scheme, each member of the team had to state their contribution out of 100%. If a student contributed 80% for example, their mark our be 80% of the teams final mark on their deliverables.

This is unfair. It's unfair because if you have 5 students, and each student takes an equal chunk of the work, and one doesn't deliver, although the student that didn't deliver will get penalised, the whole team will now be missing a 5th of their deliverables, and therefore will lose marks because of lazy member of their team.

To solve this, I would suggest that each member of the team gets together at the start, agrees and formally specifies their responsibilities, and then shares them with their lectures. Then each person can be marked on their deliverables. The downside of this may mean that some of the team aspect is lost since each person is now essentially working for themselves and their own mark. But I would argue, in the case of a software project, that each persons work still relies on another's because they have to connect and integrate together, yet they still won't get penalised if the person they should be integrating with doesn't do their work.

# Distinct roles

Finding distinct roles was hard in the case of my group. We had too many people for the tasks we had to do, and struggled to break our tasks down enough. This meant some people had to work on the same things, and then the lines became blurred on who had to deliver what. And in some cases, some students took advantage of this.

# To improve

Next time, I would love to pick my own team above anything. I started off the module very excited at the prospect of building my first application with a team. But a few weeks in, I noticed that a few of the other students didn't really care about software and didn't get involved to contribute. They often left me to organise and chase up most things.

I'd also spend more time at the start clearly defining who's doing what and when it's due by. I did make it very clear with my team as to what each of use are doing, which was decided by us all, and their deadlines, and the penalty in terms of contribution percentage for not meeting them. I wish I'd have identified the motivation and independence of my team earlier so I could have been stricter with chasing up. As a result of not doing this, I spent time at the end of the project rushing to complete other people's features before our VIVA.

# Conclude

Group project is a fantastic module, and one that solidifies many of the things students have learnt over their course, and gives them a chance to learn important communication skills that will help them shine once they leave university.
