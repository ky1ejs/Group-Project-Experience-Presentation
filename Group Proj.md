# The good

^ Module important
^ First insight
^ Communitcation skills

---

#Prepping for the real world

^ Academia is not real world
^ Gives first simulation
^ conflict, pm

---

#Culture experimentation

^ I've worked two startups
^ good contrast
^ Culture is everything
^ can't practice it easily in real world

---

#Practing conflict resolution

^ Internal and external
^ dealing well gives shine
^ no module on this

---

#Practicing team workflows and managment

^ quite specific to my subject
^ First time you practice

# The bad

^ My points are on spec, idea of group is great

---

# Picking Teams

^ aspiration alignment
^ weren't able to pick
^ bad because mistmatch aspiration
^ All of the good is wasted
^ wouldn't happen in worlplace (sack)
^ gives chance to manage? that's all they'll get
^ Unis don't measure motivation
^ choose own team
^ high aspiring student is wasted with low

---

# If your team fails, you fail

^ one miss theirs, marks capped
^ define workload at start
^ formally agree with lecturer
^ integration keeps team

---

# Finding distinct roles for each person can be tough

^ therefore marking is tough

---

# To improve...
## ...next time I would

^ love to pick team
^ stronger discipline with workload
^ did define, but wasn't enough


---

# To conclude

---

# Thank you!
